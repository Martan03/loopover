## Installation

You have to compile it yourself, but that shouldn't be a problem. Only thing you need is cargo. You need to go to the loopover project folder and run:

```
cargo build -r
```

After it's done compiling, you can start it in `./target/release/loopover`.

## Usage

You can start `loopover` in default size *(3x3)* like this:
```
./loopover
```

If you want to play with custom game size, you can do it like this:
```
./loopover -s <width> <height>
```

All the usage and options can be seen in the help:
```
./loopover -h
```

## Detailed description

### What is Loopover?

It's sliding tile puzzle game, which was originaly created by carykh. It's
displayed on a grid of a chosen size. The board is then scrambled and players
goal is to solve the puzzle so the numbers are in ascending order. Solving is
done by sliding rows and columns.

### TUI & usage description

When you start the game, you can immediately see the game itself. To scramble
the board, you can press `Enter` key, after which you can start solving the
puzzle. By using `Arrow` keys you can change selected cell and when pressing
`Shift` together with any `Arrow` key, you slide from selected position to
direction corresponding to the arrow pressed. The timer is started after the
first sliding move and after finishing the solve, it's saved in the stats.

### Statistics

Currently, only last few solves are displayed on the right of the board, but
statistics page will be added later.

### Other keybinds
- `q`/`Esc`: exit the game
